                    Diamond drilling is the most efficient method of forming holes and openings in a multitude of hard building materials including reinforced concrete, brickwork and natural stone.
                    Diamond drilling can be carried out through virtually any thickness of wall or floor. The diamond drilling system is dust free and has a relatively low noise output. Various types of drill rigs enable drilling to be carried out in confined spaces, at angles and at inverted positions.
                    Stitch drilling (drilling a series of overlapping holes) can be used to form openings of any shape.                     
                    Diamond drilling is also used to create holes for anchor bolts and for producing concrete core samples for analysis.

                    <p class="secondary-text">
                        Typically used to cut horizontal flat surfaces such as concrete slabs, roads, bridge decks and car parks to facilitate the removal of structural sections or to form expansion joints.
                        Floor saws are self propelled. An operator walks behind the machine controlling the speed and depth of cutting.
                        Diesel or electrically powered machines can be used to cut depths of up to 600mm.

                    <p class="secondary-text">
                        Wall sawing is often used to form door and window openings. A track mounted saw with a diamond blade provides precision cuts in concrete walls or inclined surfaces. The track is attached to the surface and guides the saw blade very quickly and accurately through the concrete.
                        Track sawing equipment can also be used to cut horizontal surfaces if limited access prevents the use of floor saws.
                        This method can be used to cut up to 1000mm deep.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="primary-text">Diamond Wire Sawing</h3>       
                    <p class="secondary-text">
                        Wire sawing is used for removing large sections of concrete where the depth of the concrete prevents the use of other sawing techniques. A multi-stranded diamond wire is fed at high speed across the concrete through a series of pulleys, driven by a powerful drive wheel.
                    </p>

                        A wide variety of hand held sawing devices are available. Typically these are used to cut out openings in brickwork and blockwork.

                <p class="secondary-text">
                    Bursting is an effective method of controlled demolition used to remove sections of concrete.
                    Bursting heads are placed in pre-drilled holes and are expanded under hydraulic pressure to produce cracks, effectively splitting the structure into smaller sections for removal.
                    Safe and very efficient, this operation is dust free and very quiet.

                <p class="secondary-text">
                    Hydraulic crunching is used to demolish floors, walls, staircases and other reinforced concrete structures.
                    Pistons are mounted within lightweight frames that are placed over the exposed edge of the structure being removed. The pistons are then forced inwards using hydraulic pressure which crushes the concrete into rubble.
                    This method is non-percussive and therefore eliminates any vibration. It is a dust free operation which uses no water and it operates silently.

                    The type of concrete works we undertake are usually those which are too small for a specialist frame contractor to undertake, but we are flexible enough to look at any concrete works you may have, whether it is sub or super structure , or whether it involves traditional formwork or permanent steel decking, which we can also install.
                    <br>    
                    On sites that cannot offer craneage to get the concrete to the workface, we can also arrange for concrete pumping.
                    When site constraints are too tight or the quantities are too small for ready mixed concrete to be delivered we can also provide a site mixing service.
                    We use independent testing laboratories to carry out our cube testing to ensure that design strengths are met.

                        Brokks are track mounted, remote controlled demolition machines that have changed the way many demolition projects are now undertaken.
                        Their small size and great strength is the combination that makes our fleet of Brokk machines the ideal solution for the most demanding demolition tasks.
                        Unrivalled in the field of confined space demolition many of our robotic Brokks can access through doorways and can be moved from floor to floor in an ordinary lift. If there is no lift then they can climb the stairs.
                        Precision digital remote control allows our trained staff to operate the machinery at a safe distance away from potential hazards such as falling debris. The dangers of HAVS are entirely eliminated.
                        Although used predominantly with a breaker attachment our Brokk machines are extremely versatile and can be fitted with a range of tools and accessories including Crushers, Steel Sheers, Buckets, Sorting/Demo Grapples and Scabblers.
                        Brokks are electrically powered which means they can be used in sensitive environments where toxic fumes and engine noise would not be permitted.

                    Mohan Building Services have carried out a large number of soft strip sub-contracts for our clients, we can remove everything installed in a building to get it back to its basic structure.
                    As well as the usual removal of floor finishes, suspended ceilings, doors and frames, skirtings, partitions, etc. we also carry out the removal of heavy duty mechanical and electrical installations including plant rooms, lifts and lift motor rooms and roof plant.
                    This work, often complex, is always carried out in tandem with light or partial demolition, where structural and/or non-structural elements of the building are demolished or adapted to make way for alterations to the building. This is usually carried out by a mixture of diamond cutting techniques, robotic demolition or hydraulic bursting/crunching, all of which are described in detail in the other sections of this website.
