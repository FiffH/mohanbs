                        Diamond drilling can be carried out through virtually any thickness of wall or floor. The diamond drilling system is dust free and has a relatively low noise output. Various types of drill rigs enable drilling to be carried out in confined spaces, at angles and at inverted positions.
                        Stitch drilling (drilling a series of overlapping holes) can be used to form openings of any shape.                     
                        Diamond drilling is also used to create holes for anchor bolts and for producing concrete core samples for analysis.
